Alif System Off demo
#####################

Overview
********

This sample can be used for basic power measurement and as an example of
subsystem off of RTSS cores in Alif Ensemble. The functional behavior is:

* Display the last reset/wakeup reason
* Set RTC for 20sec which make sure system goes to idle task(Normal sleep)
* Wait for the RTC interrupt
* Set the RTC again for 20sec and turn the system off
* System reboots once the RTC interrupt triggers and the above steps continue

Note: If using a USB hub to connect the UART, it is advised to set the
BOOT_DELAY to 5sec to make sure UART logs are not missed in the PC after reset.


This sample is specific to single subsystem. For the complete SoCto transition
to global states(IDLE/STANDBY/STOP), it requires voting from all the remaining
subsystem in the SoC.
