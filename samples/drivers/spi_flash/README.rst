SPI-Flash Test
###############

Overview
********

This is the test application to test and verify the Flash Read,Write and Erase opearations over OSPI interface.
The OSPI driver placed under *modules/hal/alif/drivers*
As of current h/w support 16bit Data Frame Size been applied for R/W.


Building and Running
********************

The application will build only for a target that has a devicetree entry with *:dt compatible:`alif,ensemble-ospi`* as a compatible.

Sample Output
=============
